@AGENTS.md

Dev Connect is a Droplet for Droppy, built with DroppyKit. AGENTS.md above is the brief: the build loop, the rules a droplet has to follow, and where the SDK's guides and sources are on this disk. The DroppyKit MCP server in `.mcp.json` gives you `droppykit_build`, `droppykit_validate`, `droppykit_shots` (the pictures of every surface, inline) and `droppykit_install` (into Droppy Playground); use the shots after every visual change, because you cannot see the harness window. Run `droppykit agent --force` to regenerate these files.
